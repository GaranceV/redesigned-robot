# Git Cheat Sheet

This repo is the compilation of my git usage knowledge, for everyday troubleshooting and life / time saver settings I have. I made it to have a trustworthy reference to go to, instead of endlessly roaming on StackOverflow when I want to do something special. I'd also be extra happy if it can help others :)

## Git pre-existing aliases
` ~ `  means commit before last  
` ^ ` means previous commit  
` -- ` makes references to a file and not a branch explicitly
