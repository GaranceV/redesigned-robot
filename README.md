# Git Cheat Sheet

## Git pre-existing aliases
` ~ `  means commit before last  
` ^ ` means previous commit  
` -- ` makes references to a file and not a branch explicitely

## [Studying repo History](studyHistory.md)
## [Fixing mistakes](fixMistakes.md)
## [My git config](myConfig.md)
## [Housekeeping the repo](housekeeping.md)

## Stashing neatly
To retrieve my stash without being overwhelmed by the stashes later:
```
git stash pop
```
Applies the changes _and_ removes from the pile.
